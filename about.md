I'm Ng Zhan Kang, class of 2021 Diploma In Information Technology graduate from <a href="https://www.sp.edu.sg/" class="underline">Singapore Polytechnic</a>. I am currently serving my nation for 2 years before i continue to pursue further education in a <a href="https://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/undergraduate-programmes/applied-artificial-intelligence" class="underline">local public university</a>.

During my schooling years in Singapore Polytechnic, I have done projects related to full-stacked web development, Machine Learning, and Deep Analysis. My final-year project team and I have also worked on creating Natural Language Processing models for a local bank to categorize companies according to their appropriate sectors based on the company description.

I interned at <a href="https://www.inspiraz.com/" class="underline">Inspiraz Technology Pte Ltd</a> from August 2021 to January 2022, where my teammate and I created a screw inspection sub-module for <a href="https://www.vizcam.net/" class="underline">Vizcam</a>, the company's machine vision software. 

I love doing volunteering activities. Some activities I have done are Meals-On-Wheels, where I deliver food to eldierlies with mobility issues. I have also volunteered in senior activity centres, preparing activites to entertain elderlies in Taman Jurong. Currently I am applying more volunterring activities so that I can better use my time during bookouts.

I also like playing badminton, swimming, cycling, running, as well as hiking around Singapore! I feel that those activities allow me to destress, as well as improving bonds with peers.
