# jibaboom.github.io (ngzhankang.github.io in future)
## Synopsis
📣 Source codes for my personal website will be stored here! Website is currently under development and will be updated as time progresses.

## Plans for this page
📣 Instead of building this webpage via the conventional HTML + CSS (and some JS) method, i will incorporate the usage of [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/). This is because ~~Hakyll makes blogging easier and i want to brag to the world~~ i wanted to challenge myself to learn new stuff and implement it to solidify my overall coding skills.

📣 The end-in-mind when developing this webpage (same concept when renovating a new house!) is to ensure that it is:
* **Simple** 
* **Responsive**
* **Easy to maintain**
* **Functionable in most devices**

Having learnt (and did assignments) in front-end, back-end and full-stacked development, i realised that making website as simplistic as possible will save you the _agony_ of maintaining dependencies in future. Design trends will always keep changing, so keeping things simple = making my life easier.

📣 Once this website is well-developed, ownership will be transferred from jibaboom(shell organisation i made) to ngzhankang(me!)

📣 More updates to come in future!
