<p>Driven. Passionate. Goofy?</p>
<p>
    That's probably what represents me best right now. I'm currently a full-time national serviceman in the Singapore Armed Forces, where i serve my 
    2 years of obligatory service to the nation.
</p>
<p>I like spending time volunteering for my community, as well as exploring various hawker foods around Singapore (I'm an avid hawker centre foodie hunter!)</p>
<p>Do hit me up via my socials (or via tele or whatsapp if you have my contact) if you feel that some aspects of this website can be improved!</p>
