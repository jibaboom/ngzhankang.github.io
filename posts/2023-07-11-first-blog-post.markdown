<h1>If</h1> you're actually reading this, you probably clicked on the link I posted in one of my instagram stories! So hello there pal!ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

To be honest, I've wanted to create this first blog post for a damn long time already LOL. I remember the first time when I was busy setting up the functionalities of the website back during early 2023, I had to travel to and fro SMU just 'cause my house was really like a sauna. Like temperature during that period was hot. _Reallyyyyy hot._ Ah damn those are the days where I would keep begging my brother for his campus card just to access Learning Commons, and work till late 12 a.m. before taking bus back home.

But anyways, I'd probably use this blog to consolidate my thoughts or stuff that I've learnt. (So maybe like personal financing? Or maybe something about coding stuff? Idk.)

Oh yeah, just a brief explanation of why my website is probably abit too simplistic? So there was a period of time where I was debating with myself whether I should settle down with a fanciful website with lots of animations and pictures going on, or just a simple website that's mainly just texts and white background. I spent a whole deal of time doing lots of research and thinking through before settling down with the latter with these few simple reasonings:

- I'm not planning to post blogs frequently, so I need to create something **simple** so that in future **I don't need to spend so much time revisiting my codes** and trying to figure out which is which.
- **Trends keep changing**, and so does the asthetics of a website. Things that may seem to look nice now might just not look nice in future. Creating something that looks simple actually would save me lots of time tearing down a webpage, just to rebuild the entire website with a brand new look, and waiting for it to become old-fashioned again in future. I'm not running a business, and neither am I an influencer, so there's no need to make it look so nice. Besides, **a website with simplistic design will never be out-of-fashion**.

So yeah, that's my rationale behind the deisgn of this website. A simple and easy to maintain website.

Not gonna lie, I'm actally experiencing writer's block as i'm typing this post outðŸ˜…. I guess I'll just end it here.

Bye!
